### NERDTree

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) allows you to explore your
filesystem and to open files and directories. It presents the filesystem to
you in the form of a tree which you manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse.
It also allows you to perform simple filesystem operations.
