# vim configuration

vimrc management is performed modularly, with features being added or removed
through curation of the `vimrc.d/` directory.  Plugin management is performed
using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## Plugins

The following plugins are currently deployed:

* [NERDTree](#nerdtree)
* [syntastic](#syntastic)
* [tagbar](#tagbar)

### NERDTree

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) allows you to explore your
filesystem and to open files and directories. It presents the filesystem to
you in the form of a tree which you manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse.
It also allows you to perform simple filesystem operations.
